  {[}TABLE: Dense region evaluation, timing vs.~accuracy: effect of
  multi scale, pooling.{]}
\item
  From the above, we select the point of high accuracy and reasonable
  cost.
\item
  {[}PLOT: Cascaded CNN timing vs.~accuracy: effect of threshold.{]}
\item
  From the above, we select threshold of high accuracy and reasonable
  cost.
