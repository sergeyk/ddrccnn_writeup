\caption[Architecture of the proposed Anytime CNN.]{
The proposed Anytime CNN augments traditional networks with fully-connected prediction layers after every computationally-expensive layer.
All prediction layers feed into an Anytime combination layer that computes accuracy and back-propagates from cost-sensitive loss.
Compare this architecture to \autoref{fig:ccnn}.
