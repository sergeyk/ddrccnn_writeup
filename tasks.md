From NIPS reviews:

- For the "Cascade" method. What form of the classifier is used here? Are the feature maps processed in any way before training the classifier?

- Will the rejected regions in the cascaded CNN be re-processed? If not, its performance should be worse than the original R-CNN at the 10000 ms time allotted (see Table. 2), as the true-positives might be filtered out in the early stage.
