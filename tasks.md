- title: change it to "timely r-cnn detection"
- abstract: r-cnn is good but has several clear problems. we consider three different ways to fix the problems, which are orthogonal: we evaluate them on their own and also combine them

- make clear in fig 2 that classification can be cascaded
- have these speed-ups been considered independently before?
- present a more coherent holistic vision
    - present whole architecture first then present parts
- or are the three parts composed into one to get past bar of acceptance? cause then it's bad
- should show on imagenet det if claim to be fast
- ning suggests doing less
