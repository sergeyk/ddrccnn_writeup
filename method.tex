\section{Method}\label{method}

Our method builds on the architecture described in R-CNN.

\subsection{Dense region evaluation}\label{dense-region-evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Explain the difference between cropping pixels and cropping
  \texttt{pool5}.
\item
  Explain design choices (single vs multi scale, finding nearest window,
  warping.
\item
  {[}FIGURE: dense region evaluation: multi-scale pyramid, warping{]}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cascaded CNN}\label{cascaded-cnn}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Explain the reject option in the CNN evaluation
\item
  Each rejector is trained to distiguish background regions from
  foreground (object) regions.
\item
  Explain training the thresholds
\item

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Explain dynamic selection of region batches
\item
  Explain iterative training procedure
\item
